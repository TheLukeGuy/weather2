# Weather2

This is an **unofficial** port of the [Localized Weather & Storms](https://coros.us/mods/weather2) mod (more commonly known as **Weather2**) to Fabric and Forge 1.16/1.18/1.19.

On top of this, some other changes are being made to ensure maintainability and portability, such as:

* Cleaning up the entire codebase with a consistent structure and code style
* Merging the required parts of CoroUtil directly into Weather2
* Rewriting the configuration code for more consistency and predictability
* And maybe more in the future?

## Why?

The original mod has been stuck on Forge 1.12 for years, and while the original developer is working on a [new version](https://github.com/Corosauce/weather2/tree/1.18_lt_server) for Forge 1.18, it still only supports Forge and seems to have larger + more time-consuming goals than a simple port of the 1.12 version.
